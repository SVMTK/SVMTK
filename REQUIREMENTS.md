# Installing additional requirements 
The installation script of SVMTK will automatically try to find 
the necessary packages. Some of the packages can already be installed, 
so it can be practical to run the install script first to get an overview 
of the missing requirements. 

Administrator privileges can be avoided by installing in a local directory. 

Be aware that the installation may fail if multiple versions of packages exists. 

The user can also opt for the usage of docker images that was described in
the [README.md](README.md)
